### How to run

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn): Download and install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) as it includes npm (Node Package Manager). Alternatively, you can use a package manager like yarn (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

Steps:

- Clone or Download the Project:

If you have Git installed, clone the repository using the following command (replace https://github.com/your-username/faq-component.git with the actual repository URL):
Bash

        
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/faq-component.git
        
        

If you don't have Git or prefer a manual download, download the project's ZIP file from the source (if available) and extract it to a folder on your computer.

Install Dependencies:

- Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt.

- Run the following command to install the required dependencies listed in the package.json file:
   
   
    npm install
    

(If you're using yarn, use yarn install instead.)

Start the Development Server:

- Run the development script using npm:

   
    npm run start
 
This will typically start a local server (usually at http://localhost:8080 or a similar address). The exact port number might vary depending on your system configuration or other running processes.

- Open the Project in Your Browser:
        
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal output after running npm run start. This will usually be http://localhost:8080 (or the specific port used).



## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Eleventy
- Nunjacks temmplating engine
- Accesibility



### What I learned

I learned how to set up an Eleventy project from scratch. I improved my use of grid and flexbox, but I'd like to work on more projects to become more confident with these box layout. I also learned about accessibility best practices for decorative elements. I learned more about sass variables and learned how to use basic components with javascript and nunjucks.

### Continued development

I want to create an extended project or template using Eleventy. This could be a portfolio website or a blog template. I'd like to practice more techniques for creating Eleventy layouts and components for static site builders.

In addition to accessibility, I want to ensure my code is compatible with all major browsers. I'm also interested in learning more techniques for creating non-standard elements and using CSS animations and transitions.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - this help me mostly with html and javascript part like optimizing javascript and images. 

- Sass, Eleventy Documentation - it help me with issues like mixin and deploying

- Lighthouse and Performance Insights Tool in Chrome - i use this tool to check performance and how my website behave on different screens (mobile, desktop, tablet)

- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com) - this is excellent website that help me check if some css like text-rendering support all browsers

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
