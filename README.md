## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Eleventy
- Nunjacks temmplating engine
- Accesibility



### What I learned

I learned how to set up an Eleventy project from scratch. I improved my use of grid and flexbox, but I'd like to work on more projects to become more confident with these box layout. I also learned about accessibility best practices for decorative elements.

### Continued development

I want to create an extended project or template using Eleventy. This could be a portfolio website or a blog template. I'd like to practice more techniques for creating Eleventy layouts and components for static site builders.

In addition to accessibility, I want to ensure my code is compatible with all major browsers. I'm also interested in learning more techniques for creating non-standard elements and using CSS animations and transitions.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - this help me mostly with html and javascript part like optimizing javascript and images. 

- Sass, Eleventy Documentation - it help me with issues like mixin and deploying

- Lighthouse and Performance Insights Tool in Chrome - i use this tool to check performance and how my website behave on different screens (mobile, desktop, tablet)

- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com) - this is excellent website that help me check if some css like text-rendering support all browsers

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
